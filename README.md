**True Circle** is a human-centered social platform designed to foster transparency, authentic connection, and community-driven engagement—offering an alternative to the noise and digital isolation of mainstream social media.

## Mission
True Circle exists to reduce the culture of depression and disconnection fostered by traditional platforms. We believe in:
- Conversations that matter
- Geniune interactions
- Algorithms designed to put the users in charge of their own content.

## Features
- Realtime post sharing with [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database)
- Image uploads and expressive content display
- Minimalist, responsive UI built with Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS
- Emotional design language for warmth and clarity
- Upvote/downvote functionality and post deletion for self-curation
